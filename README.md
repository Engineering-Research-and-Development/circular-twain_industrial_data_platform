<div align="justify">
The Circular TwAIn Industrial Data Platform (IDP) is an open-source infrastructure designed to manage and integrate industrial digital twin data. Its primary purpose is to facilitate data ingestion, transformation, and mapping from diverse sources, such as sensors and devices, into a predefined data structure. Acting as a mediator between digital twins and broader data spaces, it supports a set of data-oriented features. Its inherent flexibility enables the extension of existing technologies and seamless connection of providers within industrial data ecosystems. 

The infrastructure incorporates a robust set of open-source technologies, selected to address comprehensive integration needs. These technologies, derived from the Circular TwAIn Reference Implementation, formed the foundation for the specific Circular TwAIn pilot implementations. Each pilot leveraged distinct features of the platform based on its unique hardware capabilities and requirements. For instance, the WEEE pilot focused on enhancing digital twin cognition through the implementation of AI algorithms, while the Petrochemical and Battery pilots prioritized data integration and data space enablement.
