<div align="justify">
The Circular TwAIn Industrial Data Platform (IDP) is an open-source infrastructure designed to manage and integrate industrial digital twin data. Its primary purpose is to facilitate data ingestion, transformation, and mapping from diverse sources, such as sensors and devices, into a predefined data structure. Acting as a mediator between digital twins and broader data spaces, it supports a set of data-oriented features. Its inherent flexibility enables the extension of existing technologies and seamless connection of providers within industrial data ecosystems. 

The infrastructure incorporates a robust set of open-source technologies, selected to address comprehensive integration needs. These technologies, derived from the Circular TwAIn Reference Implementation, formed the foundation for the specific Circular TwAIn pilot implementations. Each pilot leveraged distinct features of the platform based on its unique hardware capabilities and requirements. For instance, the WEEE pilot focused on enhancing digital twin cognition through the implementation of AI algorithms, while the Petrochemical and Battery pilots prioritized data integration and data space enablement.

### Are there any legal issues with AGPL 3.0? Is it safe for me to use?

No problem in using a product licensed under AGPL 3.0. Issues with GPL (or AGPL) licenses are mostly related with the
fact that different people assign different interpretations on the meaning of the term “derivate work” used in these
licenses. Due to this, some people believe that there is a risk in just _using_ software under GPL or AGPL licenses
(even without _modifying_ it).

For the avoidance of doubt, the owners of this software licensed under an AGPL 3.0 license wish to make a clarifying
public statement as follows:

"Please note that software derived as a result of modifying the source code of this software in order to fix a bug or
incorporate enhancements is considered a derivative work of the product. Software that merely uses or aggregates (i.e.
links to) an otherwise unmodified version of existing software is not considered a derivative work, and therefore it
does not need to be released as under the same license, or even released as open source."
